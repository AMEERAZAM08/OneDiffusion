## Usage

Currently, stable-diffusion-xl only supports PyTorch. Make sure ``torch`` is available in your system.

\b
stable-diffusion-xl will use stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0 as the default model. To change any to any other Stable Diffusion XL
saved pretrained, or a fine-tune model, provide ``ONEDIFFUSION_STABLE_DIFFUSION_XL_MODEL_ID='stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0'``
or provide `--model-id` flag when running ``onediffusion start stable-diffusion-xl``:

\b
$ onediffusion start stable-diffusion-xl --model-id stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0
